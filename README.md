-Sorting algorithms & Big O
About this group project:
In this section, we will look at some sorting algorithms written in C, such as:

        Bubble sort-     Bubble sort repeats steps through a list of elements, swaps if they are wrong and compares                          adjacent items.
        Insertion sort-  It builds sorted arrays one by one.
        Selection sort-  Works by finding the minimum element from an unsorted part of an array. Then places it at                           the beginning of the sorted array.
        Quick sort -     It is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that divides an array into smaller subarrays                             and sorts these independently to achieve a sorted array.
